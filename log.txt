Week 1:
Design: 7 hrs
Coding and Debugging: 3 hr
Dealing with Big bugs: 1 hrs

*   The thing I am counting as the "big bug" is the build system. Since I have
    never used Maven before, it took a lot of trial and error to get it playing
    nicely. I decided on Maven because my job uses it and I wanted practice.

*   It is hard to keep track of the hours spent designing! I find myself
    thinking about configurations constantly. It is interesting because I
    think I have it figured out, it takes only a few minutes to code, and
    I come across a problem in the architecture. Back to designing.

*   The majority of coding and debugging time went to getting adjusted to
    Kotlin, which I have never used before. Although much of Java translates
    to Kotlin, the slight syntactical differences meant I was checking the
    references constantly. So far I am really enjoying the language.

*   I totally recommend getting a programming style plug-in. With languages
    I have used for a while, there's a certain personal style I've grown used
    to. I never felt the need for these tools. Now that I am coding in a brand
    new language, I have no prejudices. I can hit a key and everything lines up
    perfectly. Things such as how to name functions and variables are not
    automated, but still the IDE gives hints & warnings.

*   Next week I will have a more detailed report, I didn't notice I should be
    keeping a daily log, rather than the weekly check-ins.

Week 2:
Design: 4 hrs
Coding and debugging: 2 hrs
Dealing with big bugs: .5 hrs

*   Not sure where to put this, most of my time I spent reading about design
    patterns, mostly from the Head First book to refresh myself as I start
    to implement more intricate parts. Also looked at more Kotlin resources
    for best practice guidelines.

*   Maven was again the biggest snag. I am using IntelliJ on my machine, and
    I hopped onto a machine with only Eclipse. It should have been seamless
    but there were some issues. I had set up tests wrong but it should work
    in any IDE now and confirmed works on the command line.

*   Starting to implementing a basic Budget object made up of a composite
    pattern of items and categories of items.

*   Planned out more keywords and commands to implement.

*   Started diagramming in UML and getting a draft going of the final report.
